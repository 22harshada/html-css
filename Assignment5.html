                    <ul>
                        <li>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was the founder of the Maratha kingdom of India.
                            The kingdom's security was entirely based on religious tolerance and the functional 
                            integration of Brahmans, Marathas, and Prabhus.</li>
                        <li>Shivaji Maharaj who was the descendant of a line of prominent nobles was very 
                            brave and fought many wars to consolidate India. At that time, 
                            India was under the Muslim rulers and divided.<del> The Mughals were in north 
                                India and the Muslim sultans of Bijapur</del> as well as of Golconda 
                                in the south of India. </li>
                        <li>The ancestral estates of Shivaji Maharaj were situated in the Deccan
                             region in the realm of Bijapur sultans. He found the suppression of the
                              Muslim rulers and the persecution of all the Hindus in the region. 
                              He was sad due to the devastating condition of <mark>the Hindus that by the age 
                                of 16 he convinced himself to be the cause of the Hinduâ€™s freedom.</mark> 
                                It was a conviction that was to sustain him throughout his whole life.</li>
